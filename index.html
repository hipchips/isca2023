      <h2>Call for Paper </h2>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
	  Machine learning (ML), high performance computing (HPC), and the convergence of both are becoming the major driving force
	  to define future computer architectures in both data center and edge. To meet the computation demands from these workloads,
	  heterogeneous computing with domain-specific accelerators (DSA) emerges as a new computing paradigm to take advantage of
	  native hardware performance. While accelerator architecture continues evolving to integrate more units/devices to boost
	  its computing horsepower, the increasing cost and power consumption of silicon give rise to chiplet architecture.
	  </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
	  The modularized design in chiplet architecture brings up several benefits: 1) Reduce the complexity of traditional monolithic
	  system-on-a-chip (SoC) design and overcome the chip area limit imposed by the reticle size of the semiconductor process.
	  2) Lower power consumption via mix-and-matching existing and/or new components and integrating them into a single package.
	  3) Shorten the development time and improve yield to lower the manufacturing costs.
	  </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
	  However, chiplet architecture also faces a few challenges: 1) Lack of standards and tools to allow different pieces of
	  silicon across vendors to work seamlessly through a common interface. 2) Enabling resource sharing among chiplets for
	  composable computing. 3) Chiplet interconnect for high communication bandwidth and low latency, especially when the
	  chip area gets close to the wafer scale. 4) Power and performance optimizations for large-scale spatial parallelism on chip.
	  </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
	  The 3rd International workshop on the High Performance Chiplet and Interconnect Architectures (<strong>HiPChips-2023</strong>) aims to
	  address these challenges and how they impact on the designs of chiplet-based architecture and software ecosystem.
	  The major objective of this workshop is to bring the latest research and development from academia and industry together
	  and foster closer collaboration to push the technologies forward. This workshop will focus on but not limited to the following topics:
	  <br>
	  Architecture:
	      <li> Chiplet-enabled architectures with emerging technologies (e.g., in-memory computing, optical computing, quantum computing, etc) </li>
	      <li> Hardware software co-designs for chiplet architecture </li>
	      <li> High performance computing architectures enabled by fast interconnect </li>
	      <li> Power and performance modeling for chiplet architectures </li>
	  Interconnect:
	      <li> Interconnect technologies for coherent and non-coherent data sharing </li>
	      <li> Emerging on-chip interconnect for large-scale heterogeneous computing </li>
	      <li> Novel software optimizations and scheduling with inter-chiplet network </li>
     </h5>
          
    <h5 class="w3-text-black">
